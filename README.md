# Terence's Next Big Thing

Terence Lee, an esteemed Senior Member of the Technical Staff, Ruby Task Force Leader and Jedi Level Conference Speaker, is so impressed with the skill level of gSchool that he's ready to leave it all behind to invest in one of you. However, to help determine where is millions of dollars will go, he's tasked you all with a challenge.

He wants a small sinatra application with a catchy name and an email sign up. This application must be on Heroku (obviously) within the hour to qualify. The email sign up should be front and center! To prove your technical chops, the email signup should save every email that comes through in a database.

Good luck! This could be it!

## Suck up to Terence

If you finish with the first task, provide a way for Terence to view the emails in the database. He's not very good at Ruby; no one actually uses bundler.

## Really suck up to Terence

Show the emails in the database *without* writing any code.
